A terminal utility to get lyrics of songs. Tested on Ubuntu 19.04. To get it to work, add a file named "access_token" with a token from the genius API in it. Controls:
 - To start the program, use `python3 curse.py` or `python3 curse.py [Search Term]`. For example, `python3 curse.py Shallow Lady Gaga`
 - Type out the search term and press Enter to search it
 - Select the correct song with W and D and then press Enter
 - Scroll up and down with W and D. You can use Ctrl-P to quit, F to go back to selection, or G to type out another search term
